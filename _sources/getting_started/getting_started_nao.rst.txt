Getting started with the Nao
=================================================

Ground Rules
----------------------------

1. Handle with care.
    a. Use two hands to carry. Best place tho hold is its chest.
    b. The fingers are brittle. Make sure when stowing the Nao away to put the hands in a safe spot.

2. Always put the Nao on a large surface, preferably the ground.
    a. The crouch and sitting positions are stable.
    b. It can stand by itself from those positions.

3. Make sure the Nao is in rest mode when its idle (e.g. when you are programming).
    a. From code: call self.nao.autonomous.request(NaoRestRequest())
    b. Via Robot: press its chest button twice to switch between rest and alive mode.

4. Keep the Nao charged.

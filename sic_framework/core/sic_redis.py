"""
sic_redis.py

A wrapper around Redis to provide a simpler interface for sending SICMessages, using two different APIs. 
The non-blocking (asynchronous) API is used for messages which are simply broadcasted and do not require a reply.
The blocking (synchronous) API is used for requests, from which a reply is expected when the action is completed.

Example Usage:
Non-blocking (asynchronous):
    ## DEVICE A
        r.register_message_handler("my_channel", do_something_fn)

    ## DEVICE B
        r.send_message("my_channel", SICMessage("abc"))


Blocking (synchronous):
    ## DEVICE A
        def do_reply(channel, request):
            return SICMessage()

        r.register_request_handler("my_channel", do_reply)

    ## DEVICE B
        reply = r.request("my_channel", NamedRequest("req_handling"), timeout=5)
    
    # here the reply is received and stored in the variable 'reply'.

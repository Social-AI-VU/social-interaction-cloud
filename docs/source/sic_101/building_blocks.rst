Building Blocks of SIC
=======================================

This section will guide you through the building blocks of the Social Interaction Cloud framework.

Components: Sensors, Actuators, and Services
----------

You can picture creating a SIC application as a process of connecting components together, or building with Legos.
Components are either sensors, actuators, or services.

Supporting Elements: ComponentManager, Connector, and Redis
----------

Other elements of SIC are used to support the components and are not directly used by the user.

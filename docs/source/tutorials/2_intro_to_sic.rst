Introduction to the Social Interaction Cloud
============================================

This tutorial will guide you through the introduction to the Social Interaction Cloud framework.

ðŸ“„ Getting Started with the Nao Robot
----------------------------

This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with the Nao robot.

For example, to show the camera feed of the robot:

In the `demo_nao_camera.py` file, make sure to adjust the ip adress to the ip adress of your robot. If you press the chest button of the robot it will tell you itâ€™s ip adress. Ensure you are on the same network as the robot, and then you are good to go!

.. code-block:: python

    nao.setIP("192.168.1.100")

To start the camera demo from the terminal, use the following commands:

**Ubuntu/Debian/MacOS**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. toggle:: Ubuntu/Debian/MacOS

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Activate the same virtual environment where you pip installed 
      # social-interaction-cloud in the installation steps
      source venv_sic/bin/activate

      # Go to sic_applications and the demo script
      cd sic_applications/demos
      python demo_nao_camera.py

**Windows**
~~~~~~~~~~~
.. toggle:: Windows

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Activate the same virtual environment where you pip installed 
      # social-interaction-cloud in the installation steps
      .\.venv_sic\Scripts\activate

      # Go to sic_applications and the demo script
      cd sic_applications\demos
      python demo_nao_camera.py

.. note::

    It might take some time to start the demo file if the SIC has never been installed on the robot.

If all goes well, a display should pop up showing you the camera output of your robot!

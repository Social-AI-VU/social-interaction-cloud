2: Introduction to the Social Interaction Cloud & Getting Started with the Nao
===============================================================================

This tutorial will guide you through the introduction to the Social Interaction Cloud framework by showing you how to use the Nao robot.

ðŸ“„ Getting Started with the Nao Robot
--------------------------------------

This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with SIC and the Nao robot.

For example, to show the camera feed of the robot:

In the `demo_nao_camera.py` file, make sure to adjust the ip adress to the ip adress of your robot (replace the XXX). If you press the chest button of the robot it will tell you itâ€™s ip adress. Ensure you are on the same network as the robot, and then you are good to go!

.. code-block:: python

    nao = Nao(ip="XXX", top_camera_conf=conf)


To start the camera demo from the terminal, use the following commands:

**Ubuntu/Debian/MacOS**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. toggle:: Ubuntu/Debian/MacOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      # Activate the same virtual environment where you pip installed 
      # social-interaction-cloud in the installation steps
      source venv_sic/bin/activate

      # Go to sic_applications and the demo script
      cd sic_applications/demos/nao
      python demo_nao_camera.py

**Windows**
~~~~~~~~~~~
.. toggle:: Windows

    .. code-block:: bash

      # Activate the same virtual environment where you pip installed 
      # social-interaction-cloud in the installation steps
      .\.venv_sic\Scripts\activate

      # Go to sic_applications and the demo script
      cd sic_applications\demos\nao
      python demo_nao_camera.py

.. note::

    It might take some time to start the demo file if the SIC has never been installed on the robot.

You should get the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Starting SIC on /data/home/nao/.venv_sic/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sic_framework/devices/nao with redis ip 192.168.2.6

    [SICComponentManager 192.168.2.7]: INFO:  - NaoqiLookAtComponent  

If all goes well, a display should pop up showing you the camera output of your robot!

API
----------------------------
The goal of SIC is to provide easy to use high level access to devices and services. For example, to make a NAO robot say something, run the following python script on your laptop! To see more functionality check out the  `sic_applications /demos <https://github.com/Social-AI-VU/sic_applications/tree/main/demos>`_ folder!

.. code-block:: python

    from sic_framework.devices import Nao  
    from sic_framework.devices.common_naoqi.naoqi_text_to_speech import NaoqiTextToSpeechRequest  

    nao = Nao(ip='192.168.0.151') # adjust this to the IP adress of your robot.  

    nao.tts.request(NaoqiTextToSpeechRequest("Hello!"))

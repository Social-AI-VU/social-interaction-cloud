4: Robot Motion
=======================================

This tutorial shows you how to play system motions, create, save, and replay custom motions, and how to stream motions from one robot to another.

ðŸ“„ Nao Motion Tutorial
----------------------------

**Connecting to the Nao**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your computer must be connected to the same network as the Nao. 
Make sure the Nao crouches safely in its resting position. Press on its chest button to turn it on. Once it is fully awake, press the chest button again to get its IP address.
Replace "XXX" with this IP address in the demo script.

.. code-block:: python

    self.nao_ip = "XXX"


**Playing Animations and Setting Posture**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We're following the ``demo_nao_motion`` script which can be found `here <https://github.com/Social-AI-VU/sic_applications/blob/main/demos/nao/demo_nao_motion.py>`_ and which contains more detailed comments.
Make sure you are connected to your Nao.

Set posture or play animation:

**To set the posture**: Second argument is the speed (NOTE: setting the speed too high may result in an error)

.. code-block:: python

    nao.motion.request(NaoPostureRequest("Stand", 0.5))

**To play an animation**: 

.. note::

    If you are playing a standing animation, make sure you put the Nao in a standing posture beforehand

.. code-block:: python

    nao.motion.request(NaoqiAnimationRequest("animations/Stand/Gestures/Hey_1"))

A list of all Nao animations can be found in the `Nao animation documentation <http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-4/naoqi/motion/alanimationplayer-advanced.html#animationplayer-list-behaviors-nao>`_.

A complete script for this tutorial can be found here: `demo_nao_motion.py <https://github.com/Social-AI-VU/sic_applications/blob/main/demos/nao/demo_nao_motion.py>`_


**Recording and Playing Custom Animations**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We're following the ``demo_nao_motion_recorder`` script which can be found `here <https://github.com/Social-AI-VU/sic_applications/blob/main/demos/nao/demo_nao_motion_recorder.py>` and which contains more detailed comments.
Make sure you are connected to your Nao.

Specify which Nao parts you want to record (NOTE: a 'chain' is a group of body parts, or a link of joints). The full list can be found in the `Nao body parts documentation <http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/family/nao_technical/bodyparts_naov6.html#nao-chains>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    chain = ["LArm", "RArm"]

Set the stiffness of these parts to 0 so that you can move them:

.. code-block:: python

    nao.stiffness.request(Stiffness(stiffness=0.0, joints=chain))  

Start the recording

    1. Set a 'record_time' variable. This is how long it will record the Nao's motion before saving it.

    2. It is recommended to include a message to indicate when to start moving the Nao

.. code-block:: python

    record_time = 10  
    print("Start moving the robot! (not too fast)")  

    nao.motion_record.request(StartRecording(chain))  

    time.sleep(record_time)  

Save the motion, give it a name:

.. code-block:: python

    recording = nao.motion_record.request(StopRecording())  
    recording.save(MOTION_NAME)  

Set the stiffness of the limbs to 0.7 so that the motors can move them. Play the recording back:

.. code-block:: python

    nao.stiffness.request(Stiffness(.7, chain))  

    recording = NaoqiMotionRecording.load(MOTION_NAME)  
    nao.motion_record.request(PlayRecording(recording))
